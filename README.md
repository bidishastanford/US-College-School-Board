# US-College-School-Board

In this project, using the US college scoreboard data set, we build two predictive models. 
The first model is built to predict the the median earnings of students while the second was to predict whether the undergrads from an institution will receive a federal loan in the academic year or not.

We built several models using different variable selection methods and then assessed the performan#ce of
the models using a validation set. Finally, we chose the following models as our best models.

The US College Scorecard data is a robust dataset of the US Department of Education. The reduced
version that I will be using has 42 columns and 7804 rows of data collected through federal reporting
from institutions, data on federal financial aid, and tax information. These institutions include Integrated
Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), and
Department of Treasury. Broadly, the data provides insights into the performance of institutions that
receive federal financial aid dollars, and the outcomes of students of those institutions.
